Working as an Executive in Data Insights at ADA , I have almost two years of experience in data science and a deep understanding of data analytics and visualization techniques. I specialize in using Python, machine learning, deep learning, Power BI, and AWS to turn data into actionable insights. My expertise lies in dealing with big data and leveraging it to drive business decisions.

In my current role, I perform data extraction on Apache Spark and Hadoop for campaign execution, conduct data mining on various sources to serve as data points for in-depth analysis, participate in product development, product analysis and onboarding, and develop end-to-end dashboards.

During my internship with Data Intelligence & Business Strategy at ADA , I conducted data research, cleaned data, performed web scraping, mined data, built a dashboard, and worked closely with the business strategy team to empower data-driven decision-making and generate insights.

As a Data Science & Business Analytics intern at The Sparks Foundation, I analyzed data to extract insights from it, built a dashboard, created a machine learning model, and evaluated or gave feedback on fellow intern tasks.

Throughout my career, I have developed a strong ability to analyze data and communicate my findings to stakeholders. I am a self-motivated and detail-oriented individual who thrives in a dynamic work environment. My experience has given me the skills to help businesses unlock the full potential of their data, enabling them to optimize their operations and drive growth.ðŸ˜„
